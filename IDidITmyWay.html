    I have always felt at home in a bakery, any bakery.
    I know today is gonna be ok when I drive into the bakery parking lot. I know I am where I belong.
    Beyond doubt it is dark and early. My sleep pattern is atrocious ( I've slept on bags of flour, more than once),
    anything but ordinary. My memories of bakeries just keep going further back into my youth and younger and younger days.
    I can tell you of days going to the “Federal Bakeshop” in St. Joseph, Mo.
    The incredible smell of fresh pastries, breads, cookies, pies, and the beautiful cakes.
    “I want” is the only way to express the desire to get everything.
    Danish has been my personal favorite of all time.
    Give me a hot danish (any flavor) right out of the oven, and I will give you anything.
    The summer after I finished kindergarten, we moved across the big Missouri River to Atchison, Ks.
    Dad had bought his first bakery. Now the bakery became my second home.
    On weekends, I’d jump at the chance to get up at 12:30am to go to work with dad.
    I wasn’t much help those days, I did a lot of watching.
    Amazed with the huge bags of flour that I couldn’t even budge. By 5am, I’d be asleep upon one of these 100 pound bags.
    Later, in the morning I’d be nudged and dad would tell me “it’s time to get busy,
    I was big enough to help clean, to grab a broom and start sweeping.
    I must be the worst sweeper of all time, it seems I’ve never graduated from sweeping.
    My duties grew with the ability to stay awake in the early mornings.
    I would stand on a milk crate and learn how to handle the donuts sticks and flip the donuts in the fryer.
    Even before I was strong enough or had the reach to dip the screens of proofed donuts
    into the grease or take them out ( or lift the glazer hopper to glaze them}.
    But, lord I got to eat warm donuts freshly made before they ever got cold.
    There is something to the saying “get em while they are hot”.
    One week it was my turn to deliver the treats for my cub scout meeting.
    I took chocolate eclairs that I had helped to finish ( fill with Parisian cream and ice the tops).
    I was a great scout! When I graduated High School, I joined the Navy like my father had done.
    I have always wanted to be like dad. After the Navy, my dad had a donut shop where I was his partner.
    I can remember all to well mixing the dough by hand with a canoe paddle. We cover a bakery rack with a tarp
    and put an electric skillet on the bottom to make steam for a simulated proof box.
    Then after awhile, we closed the donut shop and both of us went to work for a central bakery in Channelview
    that distributed baked goods to a half dozen grocery stores.
    Here at this large bakery there were 2 huge revolving ovens that could hold  75 full sheet pans at a time.
    I also experienced a pizza oven at this time, where it was necessary to turn the pans from inside end
    to outside end to get an even bake.This took away labor from doing other things
    since it needed rotated every few minutes or the end in back of oven would burn rapidly.
    A walk through proof box where you put a rack in one and then another rack and then another rack
    till the first rack came out the other end ready for the oven.
    Here is where I began mixing on the big Hobart mixers. Breads were divided up (scaled) by hand kneaded
    and balled up by hand and then pounded flat and rolled into loaves by hand.
    A German baker taught me how to braid Challah bread. I learned how to run my first dough sheeter
    to turn large loaves of dough into long thin sheets to cut doughnuts.
    Pick the donuts up 6 at a time with both hands and lay the dozen doughnuts in lines on the frying screens
    (whereas in our donut shop we had a  single biscuit cutter to cut the donuts one at a time).
    Also there was a dutchess dough divider that you put a 3 or 5 pound piece of dough into and out came 36 pieces the same size.
    A cookie machine called the cookie king cranked out cookies as fast as you could crank the handle.
    We would get 35 pound cans of frozen fruit and add sugar and starch and cinnamon to make pie filling.
    A pie press was available for making pie crusts in the aluminum pie pans.
    Here we used ingredients from ”JW Allen” which probably is on the higher end of price to make the best products you can find.
    Opposed to Rustco products which would be on the cheaper end.
    The Rustco items seem to always be doctored up to get a into presentable product.
    In between, I’ve used Best Brands, American Products, Pillsbury, Dawn,Durkee, and Riches,
    all being superior to Rustco and falling shy of the JW Allen supplies.
    I managed to get married along about this time and never worked with my father again.<br>
    One of the first jobs I had as a family man was for Jamail’s of Kingwood.
    I began as a donut fryer and was a baker in a heartbeat and bakery manager as soon as you could turn around.
    I began making items you could not find anywhere else. Like chocolate mint cake and pineapple coconut orange bundt rings.
    For the first time, the Kingwood bakery outperformed the other Jamail’s locations
    in contribution to store profits with better labor control and less shrink.
    After this I found myself in Lubbock working for Furr’s Inc. at their Food Emporium stores.
    Along with the full line bakery there was a tortilla shop for fresh tortillas.
    It was in these food emporium bakeries I worked hand in hand with several
    Mexican bakers who showed me some Mexican baking.
    We mixed cookies by hand on table top without any bowls or utensils, just our hands.
    We made Pan de Huevo, Semitas de anis, Bolillos, Empanadas, and Wedding cookies.
    I was introduced to the double wing sheeter and an automatic bread machine.
    For the first time, I made cheesecake from scratch as well as hand rolled croissants
    we sold each afternoon for a quarter a piece hot out of the oven..
    We also provided breads and sweets for “The Bistro’” restaurant and a satellite location of The Bistro.
    This was a 5000 square foot bakery with it’s own receiving dock and massive walk in coolers and freezers.
    This was also the first bakery where we recycled from day old sweets into Banana Nut Bread, and Blonde Brownies.
    I went on to Albetrtson’s and once again worked through donut fryer
    (here there was a duel set of fryers that took considerable timing to run both at the same time)
    where we kicked out hundreds of dozen donuts every day.
    We used an electric cookie king machine which took two people to operate
    (one would feed pans into machine while the second would catch them coming out.
    It was here in Amarillo that upon arrival to work we would check which direction the wind was blowing.
    If wind came from west at good speed it would help the oven to bake faster, and if the wing came hard enough from the east
    it would slow down the rate of speed the oven functioned at.
    With Albertsons I transfer numerous times till I ended up in Conroe as Albertsons broke the Houston market.
    In Houston I travelled around (on top of managing my bakery) to over 20 new store openings
    and help train the new store bakery staff. Grand openings were Working for Albertsons,
    I received the “Triple Crown Award” for making my goals more than once, and bonused 3 out of 4 quaters each year
    for outdoing projections. Once a month, we had “French Bread Saturday”,
    when our goal was to sell 1000 loaves of French bread on 1 day.
    It was challenging enough to get 1000 loaves baked in one day on top of carrying on with normal production.
    And then to get the bread sold the same day. One month, we had the French bread contest each year
    to see who could sell the most in the month.
    My best effort churned out 11,000 loaves, a record still standing today.
    It was standard business at Albertsons to have boy scouts come into store and demo chocolate chip cookies,
    and sell bags of cookies where at the end of the day they would take a quarter home for each bag sold.
    I was the only one ever to utilize the local High School’s French club to come into the store for the month
    to demo the French bread and talk French to the customers to achieve success.
    Then the French club got money to put towards their summer trip to France.

In December 2003, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first flight of the Wright brothers, the New York Times ran a story entitled “Staying Aloft; What Does Keep Them Up There?” The point of the piece was a simple question: What keeps planes in the air? To answer it, the Times turned to John D. Anderson, Jr., curator of aerodynamics at the National Air and Space Museum and author of several textbooks in the field.

What Anderson said, however, is that there is actually no agreement on what generates the aerodynamic force known as lift. “There is no simple one-liner answer to this,” he told the Times. People give different answers to the question, some with “religious fervor.” More than 15 years after that pronouncement, there are still different accounts of what generates lift, each with its own substantial rank of zealous defenders. At this point in the history of flight, this situation is slightly puzzling. After all, the natural processes of evolution, working mindlessly, at random and without any understanding of physics, solved the mechanical problem of aerodynamic lift for soaring birds eons ago. Why should it be so hard for scientists to explain what keeps birds, and airliners, up in the air?

Adding to the confusion is the fact that accounts of lift exist on two separate levels of abstraction: the technical and the nontechnical. They are complementary rather than contradictory, but they differ in their aims. One exists as a strictly mathematical theory, a realm in which the analysis medium consists of equations, symbols, computer simulations and numbers. There is little, if any, serious disagreement as to what the appropriate equations or their solutions are. The objective of technical mathematical theory is to make accurate predictions and to project results that are useful to aeronautical engineers engaged in the complex business of designing aircraft.

But by themselves, equations are not explanations, and neither are their solutions. There is a second, nontechnical level of analysis that is intended to provide us with a physical, commonsense explanation of lift. The objective of the nontechnical approach is to give us an intuitive understanding of the actual forces and factors that are at work in holding an airplane aloft. This approach exists not on the level of numbers and equations but rather on the level of concepts and principles that are familiar and intelligible to nonspecialists.

It is on this second, nontechnical level where the controversies lie. Two different theories are commonly proposed to explain lift, and advocates on both sides argue their viewpoints in articles, in books and online. The problem is that each of these two nontechnical theories is correct in itself. But neither produces a complete explanation of lift, one that provides a full accounting of all the basic forces, factors and physical conditions governing aerodynamic lift, with no issues left dangling, unexplained or unknown. Does such a theory even exist?
Two Competing Theories

By far the most popular explanation of lift is Bernoulli’s theorem, a principle identified by Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli in his 1738 treatise, Hydrodynamica. Bernoulli came from a family of mathematicians. His father, Johann, made contributions to the calculus, and his Uncle Jakob coined the term “integral.” Many of Daniel Bernoulli’s contributions had to do with fluid flow: Air is a fluid, and the theorem associated with his name is commonly expressed in terms of fluid dynamics. Stated simply, Bernoulli’s law says that the pressure of a fluid decreases as its velocity increases, and vice versa
